Calendar Notification App Challenge Task

To run the code, you need to have a google API_KEY and CLIENT_ID. These you get from https://console.developers.google.com/ under credentials when you setup your project name and APIs.
Copy and paste the API_KEY and CLIENT_ID respectively into the text2Speech.js file under the API_KEY and CLIENT_ID fields.
Ensure you put the same url or path where your files are located under Javascript Authorised Origins when setting up.
Click the authorise button, select a google account to sign in with or create one and allow permission requests.

Thank you
